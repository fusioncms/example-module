# Quotes Modules
This is an example quotes module for FusionCMS v6. This module is not meant to be used for production. Something like quotes is easily created and stored natively in the CMS through the matrix. What this is, however, is an example of how to structure add-on modules that can extend and hook in to the core API of FusionCMS.

In this module, you'll find examples of the following:
- Loading API routes
- Loading Datatable routes
- Loading Web routes
- Loading CSS and JS resources
- Register control panel navigation
- Registering settings
- Registering configs
- Redirecting to an installer-specific page on install
- Creating database tables
- Basic CRUD actions and pages
